Do any of these refrains sound familiar?
* Software development is part art, part science. 
* There is no recipe or prescription, other than a measure of knowledge, a handful of experience, a heavy dose of discipline, and a dash of creativity. 
* We're constantly creating new things and solving new problems that are both complex and complicated. 
* It's a relatively new field compared to other well-established and mature trades, such as manufacturing and engineering, so you can't expect us to simply pump out fault-tolerant and performant code on predictable or even fixed timelines.
* Software developing is not the same as building bridges or skyscrapers, we _innovate_!

So what the heck is "checklist driven development"? 

While there are certainly some truths in the refrains above, they are buried in misconceptions. If you are in an urban area, take a look out your office window and tell me how many office towers, condos, sports venues, shopping malls or bridges that are based on a cookie-cutter template?

I just finished reading [“The Checklist Manifesto”](http://atulgawande.com/book/the-checklist-manifesto/) by Atul Gawande, an experienced surgeon. The author makes a distinction between errors of ignorance (mistakes we make because we don’t know enough) and errors of ineptitude (mistakes we made because we don’t make proper use of what we know) and draws parallels between the commercial aviation and large-scale construction industries (malls, skyscrapers, etc) and how their project management and implementation practices evolved to arrive at their current level reliability. I also learned that a "Master Builder" is a real thing, referring to the construction paradigm that reigned prior to the industrial revolution. That shed a whole new light on The Lego Movie for me.

I digress...

It turns out that checklists comprise a critical component of these processes. He then contrasts this with the medical industry (specifically the operations of critical care units), which has historically been resistant to such thinking, relying on individual knowledge and expertise to deal with unpredictable events in crisis situations. The author then proceeds to describe case studies in which he advocated for, and managed to introduce checklists (despite a fair amount of resistance, I may add) to the operations of select critical care units. The results - the number of procedural errors identified and corrected, and the corresponding drop in infection rates, deaths, recovery periods and operational costs - were dramatic. His findings made their way to the World Health Organization and is resulting in tranformational changes in the field.

The objective of The Checklist Manifesto is to challenge the reader to consider how checklists apply to their profession, and to prepare one to expect some resistance when introducing the practice. While reading this book, I considered if this line of thought had been applied to the software development industry. I think the parallels to our field are obvious. A Google search of "checklist driven development" confirms I'm hardly the first person to draw parallels. Here is just [one example.](https://blog.learnosity.com/2016/07/01/checklist-driven-development/)

Some ideas on how checklists would be effective in software development:
* a [scrum checklist](https://www.crisp.se/gratis-material-och-guider/scrum-checklist)
* pre-code review checklists
* code review checklists
* solution design checklists
* solution design review checklists
* user or job story checklists
* unit, integration, and performance test checklists
* issue creation checklists
* interview checklists

Some tips for making checklists effective:
* review and refine them regularly
* keep them brief, focusing on the most critical and overlooked items
* if a single checklist is too long or generic to be effective, consider multiple checklists specialized for each scenario

Finally, remember that a checklist is not a recipe or prescription and does not replace skill and expertise. It is a guide to ensure the routine items are not overlooked.
